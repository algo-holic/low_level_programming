Trying to present [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) value evaluation in forked process =)

## How to compile and run

To compile and run [C code](main.c) use following command:
```
$ gcc -o main *.c && ./main                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
## Input data

Example of input data is given below:
```
Collatz Conjecture >>> Collatz Conjecture >>> Please enter a integer number greater than 0.
123456
```
