An introduction to fun function usage in C =)

## How to compile and run C part

To compile and run C file use following command:
```
$ gcc -o main <specify_.c_source_filename_here> && main                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

For example to run functions.c source file:
(ex. functions.c)
```
$ gcc -o main functions.c && main                   
```
