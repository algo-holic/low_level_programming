Trying to present computing PI value using [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) method in thread =)

## How to compile and run

To compile and run [C code](main.c) use following command:
```
$ gcc -pthread -o main *.c && ./main                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
## Input data

Example of input data is given below:
```
Enter a positive number for the amount of points you would like to generate? 
30000000
```                                                                                                                                                                                                               

## Output data:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

Example of output data for 30000000 value is given below:
```
The approximate value of pi for the desired amount of points (30000000) is: 3.141742                                                                                                                                                                             
```
